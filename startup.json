Finishing schooling, Sikandar's graduation dreams were shattered by his father's poverty. Left with no option, he started working as a migrant worker in a strawberry farm in Hisar, Haryana. Offered Rs 3,500 a month, on the condition that he wouldn't leave before six months, the job seemed harsh, but turned out to be a blessing in disguise. As he picked up the skills, Sikandar started considering replicating the idea back home. He wondered why we shouldn't be do such farming on our land. After all, there was not much difference in the climate, When Sikandar returned home in 2013, he carried seven strawberry saplings. The entire village was sceptic. The only person to trust his instinct was his father, Brij Kishore Mehta. Together, they planted the saplings, which produced 50 daughter plants in 2014. Sikandar and his father went back to Hisar to get more strawberry saplings. This time, the yield surpassed their expectations. And got yield at Rs 750 per kg of strawberry..",

The package allows families to stay on the farms for eight to nine nights over the three months and practice farming. In their absence, an Organic Mandya farmer will take care of the entire land.

She also visited various institutes such as the CIAE in Bhopal and the UAS in Dharwad. Her research made her realize the large gap that existed between the needs of the Indian farmer and the expensive, large-sized, imported machinery used in farming. Devi decided to use her machine development skills to help small farmers. A hardcore city girl, Devi had never visited a farm before. But once she became focused on developing products for the sector, she began to attend farmer fairs, travel to fields across the country and survey farmers to better understand their needs and the products already available in the market. Often, she juggled her newfound interest in farm equipment with her day job at the family firm.Kamal Kisan first manufactured a vegetable planter in July 2015. The product was priced low to make it affordable to small farmers. The feedback was overwhelming. Foremost among these is the Vegetable Planter, a handy low-cost machine that eases the cultivating process of most fruit and vegetable saplings with an increased process efficiency.The planter allows for a single laborer to plant a one acre plot with vegetable seedlings within four hours, as opposed to a conventional planter that requires four laborers to achieve the same results. Furthermore, it is portable and easy to operate, manufactured with high-quality steel and equipped to adjust planting depth according to the seeds being worked with. Another popular creation is the Kamal Kisan Mulch Layer, a tractor-attached device that can lay plastic mulch sheets between three to four feet, covering soil in a single pass. The first-of-its-kind Sugarcane Planter has also received positive reviews.",

I am passionate about finding that model, that can revolutionise the agriculture sector for small farmers in India.” ONganic was founded in November, 2015, and has its presence in Hanskhali Block of Nadia. In the past three years, the enterprise has trained farmers in organic cultivation, input preparation, seed saving, and good post-harvest practices. It has organised farmers into a farmers’ produce company — ON Farm Fresh Innovation Producers Company Limited — supported by NABARD.“We are building our niche through product differentiation, by growing exotic, aromatic and diabetic varieties of black rice and red rice. Many of its by-products including rice husk, bran, and oil cakes, which are generated during the production phase are then sold as fish food, chicken feed, etc.” Ekta adds.Using automation and technology to bring down cost of cultivation and increase productivity, ONganic farmers receive 25 percent premiums on their produce.
